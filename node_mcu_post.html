<h2>What is Node MCU and What are its applications</h2>
<p><img src="./images/nodmcu.png" alt="images1"></p>
<pre><code>NodeMCU is an open-source LUA based firmware developed for the ESP8266 wifi chip. By exploring functionality with the ESP8266 chip, NodeMCU firmware comes with the ESP8266 Development board/kit i.e. NodeMCU Development board.

<ul>
<li>
<p>The NodeMCU (Node MicroController Unit) is an open source software and hardware development environment that is built around a very inexpensive System-on-a-Chip (SoC) called the ESP8266.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ESP8266, designed and manufactured by Espressif Systems, contains all crucial elements of the modern computer: CPU, RAM, networking (wifi), and even a modern operating system and SDK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When purchased at bulk, the ESP8266 chip costs only $2 USD a piece. That makes it an excellent choice for IoT projects of all kinds.

<h2>How to start with NodeMCU?</h2>
<p>NodeMCU Development board is featured with wifi capability, analog pin, digital pins, and serial communication protocols.</p>
<p>To get started with using NodeMCU for IoT applications first we need to know about how to write/download NodeMCU firmware in NodeMCU Development Boards. And before that where this NodeMCU firmware will get as per our requirement.</p>
<p>There are online NodeMCU custom builds available using which we can easily get our custom NodeMCU firmware as per our requirement.</p>
<p>To know more about how to build custom NodeMCU firmware online and download it refer to Getting started with NodeMCU</p>
<h2>How to achieve the our goals with Node MCU</h2>
<ol>
<li>Through its pins we can read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message -and turn them into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.</li>
<li>It has also WiFi capabilities, so we can control it wirelessly and make it work on a remote installation easily!</li>
<li>We can tell our board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.</li>
<li>To do so we can use the the Arduino Software (IDE).</li>
</ol>
