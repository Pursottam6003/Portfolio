<h1><strong>LIDAR</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Lidar</strong> — Light Detection and Ranging — is a remote sensing method used to examine the surface of the Earth.</h3>

<h3><em>Defination</em></h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li>It is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.</li>
<li>These light pulses—combined with other data recorded by the airborne system — generate precise, three-dimensional information about the shape of the Earth and its surface characteristics.</li>
</ol>
<h2>History of Lidar</h2>
<ol>
<li>Lidar or light detection and ranging, is a popular remote sensing method used for measuring the exact distance of an object on the earth’s surface.</li>
<li>Even though it was first used in the 1960s when laser scanners were mounted to aeroplanes, LiDAR didn’t get the popularity it deserved until twenty years later.</li>
<li>It was only during the 1980s after the introduction of GPS that it became a popular method for calculating accurate geospatial measurements.</li>
<li>Now that its scope has spread across numerous fields, we should know more about LiDAR mapping technology and how it works.</li>
<li>What is LiDAR technology and how does it work? Here are a few insights about it that are good to know.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Principal and Overview</h2>
<p>A lidar instrument principally consists of a laser, a scanner, and a specialized GPS receiver. Airplanes and helicopters are the most commonly used platforms for acquiring lidar data over broad areas. Two types of lidar are topographic and bathymetric. Topographic lidar typically uses a near-infrared laser to map the land, while bathymetric lidar uses water-penetrating green light to also measure seafloor and riverbed elevations.</p>

<li>
<p>Lidar systems allow scientists and mapping professionals to examine both natural and manmade environments with accuracy, precision, and flexibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOAA scientists are using lidar to produce more accurate shoreline maps, make digital elevation models for use in geographic information systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To assist in emergency response operations, and in many other applications.</p>

<li>
<p>Lidar data sets for many coastal areas can be downloaded from the Office for Coastal Management Digital Coast web portal.</p>
