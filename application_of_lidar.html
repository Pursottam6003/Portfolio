<h2><strong>The importance of LiDAR technology in self-driving vehicles.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>LiDAR technology allows self-driving vehicles to make calculated decisions with its ability to detect objects in its immediate environment.</li>
<li>It can be thought of as a vehicle’s “set of eyes” and the most important component in making self-driving vehicles a reality.</li>
<li>Automakers are leveraging this technology as they compete to develop self-driving vehicles which are safe.</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>How can one feel comfortable with this technology? LiDAR systems can see things that go beyond human abilities ?</em></h3>
<p>Imagine if your eyesight provided continuous 360-degree visibility or if your depth perception was always correct and you never had to guesstimate stopping distances between your car and those cars in front of you. LiDAR makes all this possible. With that being said, LiDAR is a technology of precision in gathering data and computing accurate distances, which promotes self-driving vehicle safety.</p>

<h3><strong>How does LiDAR work in self-driving vehicles?</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>LiDAR allows a vehicle to see where it’s going. The LiDAR system works by measuring the objects distances relative to the self-driving vehicle’s position to create a 3D replica of the environment.</li>
<li>An integrated computer system measures the time between the initial laser pulses and the receiver using the speed of light to compute the distance the light has traveled.</li>
<li>LiDAR emits and computes data from 100,000s of laser pulses every second. It uses these data points to form a point cloud and create 3D models of objects in its surroundings.</li>
<li>After LiDAR sees objects, it identifies them (i.e. vehicles, pedestrians) and predicts their behaviors to determine the vehicle’s reaction.</li>
</ol>
